Hi guys, I'm Kelvin Kuo from Beijing China. I have been a software engineer for over ten years. I worked in several fields including online-game, live-broadcast, and e-commerce systems. Always focusing on backend system. Recently I worked on Go, micro-service, k8s ...

Besides I'm obsessed with marathons and reading.
